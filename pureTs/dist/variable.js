//               any type
// any type is not reccomended to use by ts official documentation. this allows user to define a custom type variable
// TypeScript also has a special type, any, that you can use whenever you don’t want a particular value to cause typechecking errors.
// When a value is of type any, you can access any properties of it (which will in turn be of type any), call it like a function, assign it to (or from) a value of any type, or pretty much anything else that’s syntactically legal:
//noImplicityAny
